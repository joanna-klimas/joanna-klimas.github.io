          Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, interpret and regulate our own feelings and feelings of the others. When I say recognize, I mean take a moment and really understand what do we feel. Is it just anger, or maybe disappointment? Is it happiness? Or maybe pride? Or maybe something else? Being emotionally intelligent means going a little deeper than just observing the surface of our emotions. Once a person is able to correctly name the feeling, they are a step closer to understanding it, and trying to regulate behaviors based on that knowledge. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Emotional intelligence has nothing to do with IQ. IQ is static. We are born with certain capacity and we can’t really change it through the course of our lives. IQ has no impact on EQ, meaning that people with high IQ can have either high or low EQ. EQ is a skill that can be learned. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          High levels of EQ are directly correlated with success. I’m perfectly aware how this sounds, but that really is a conclusion drawn from every source I referred to while researching this topic. Higher levels of EQ are observed in people on middle-management level in professional organizations. People with higher EQ levels are able to form more meaningful relationships, hence are happier. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          What I find appealing in working on EQ is its’ almost therapeutical impact. Taking time to understand emotions and accepting that they are okey, no matter if the general perception of  anger or rage are bad, and happiness or love are good. They are all very human, and what defines us is our reactions to the emotions, not emotions themselves.

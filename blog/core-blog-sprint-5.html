          What I have learned about myself 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          What I learned is that I need to constantly remind myself of capabilities that my brain has. For me, that’s the whole secret of growth mindset. It would be beautiful to be in this conscious growth state the whole time. It does not work like this for me, unfortunately. I think to get there, it is important to maintain certain level of self-awareness that separates me as a person from my work, my achievements and also my setbacks, and allows to accept the fact that I may not know all the answers at the moment. Or ever for that matter.

          Biggest surprise in core material
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I was surprised how consistent the whole core material was. At the beginning it felt like just a handful of different, unrelated skills that are useful for a future developer. What it turned out to be, is nicely designed path to increase self-awareness. What keeps surprising me is the whole idea and application of growth mindset. How simple decision of stopping myself for a moment to think about my approach can change the level of frustration with my learning outcomes.

          Biggerst challenge in core material
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          The biggest challenge for me was meditation. Surprisingly, as I used to do quite a bit of yoga, and I thought this will come quite natural to me. I don’t know what is it about meditation that just does not work well for me. I find it extremely difficult to focus on and stay in it for a few minutes. For some reason a gym room full of people is less distracting then my own house.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I think one of the big reasons is that people who jump into IT career with no technical background find themselves quite hopeless when encountering a problem sometimes. It is a lot to take in such a short time, and it can be overwhelming. I’m sure it would be the same with any other career change too. The core part of the program helps to go through that feeling, and I’m sure decreases number of drop outs. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Core material essentially teaches how to learn. As career in IT means learning new things on daily basis, these skills will be very useful after graduating from bootcamp and entering professional environment.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          Was going through core program a waste of time
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I would not spent years in HR if I thought that learning professional skills was a waste of time. These are skills we are using, consciously or not, not only at work, but also at home. Bringing better self-awareness, no matter if it’s though meditation or emotional intelligence, or any other tool or concept, makes our lives easier.

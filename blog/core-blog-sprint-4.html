            Referring back to my previous post on emotional intelligence, I have to admit that I was wrong about IQ. Looking a little deeper and reading a few articles about growth mindset and neuroplasticity I realized that there is nothing static about our brains, including IQ. In fact, thinking that IQ is a static value is an example of fixed mindset approach.

          <p class="content is-medium">
            Getting back to the subject of this post. What I think is important about growth and fixed mindset, is understanding that we make choices between two of them every day. Neuroplasticity is a fact. There are number of studies proving that growth mindset boosts learning experience. Why not make a choice each time when faced with a challenge than? 
          </p>
      
          <p class="content is-medium">
            I was thinking of how to incorporate a growth mindset into my learning experience. There are a few tools that already facilitate it. That includes reflection, meditation, writing this sort of posts. At the end, a lot about it is self-awareness and being able to identify which state am I in, and consciously switch it if needed. Or celebrate, if it’s not. This makes it really close to emotional intelligence as an ability to identify and regulate emotions. Mindset is essentially how do we feel about certain situation. Being aware and regulating these two mindset is essentially mastering EQ.

          I have a few years of HR experience under my belt and I got a chance to fill out a few personality tests and work with the results. I suppose this gives me quite an in-depth understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. 
        </p>
              
        <p>
          What I value the most is logic. I’m quite good at putting emotions aside and focusing on different factors and their consequences. I enjoy solving problems and building complex logical concepts. I often ask myself „is that the best way?”. These qualities can be easily seen as both my strengths and weaknesses.

          Some time ago I was made responsible for an optimization project. I was supposed to analyze certain processes in the business and look for efficiencies. The reason why I was chosen to go ahead with this project was being logical and analytical, and really interested in optimization. I happily started working on mapping processes and people’s roles, followed by remapping both. I thought it was very exciting to free up people’s time and potential. What I did not pay enough attention to was that some of my colleagues found it horrifying.

          Following my logical train of thought often makes me forget about emotional support others may need. I am type of person who asked to listen about other’s problems will start suggesting solutions and looking for logic. While what others often need is someone to JUST listen.

          I come from a culture driven by results. Of course, the process of getting to them is important too, but what really matters is not how big and impressive my professional network is, but what I accomplished. Being in NZ for almost 2 years I found that professional culture here is quite different. I’m not saying that NZ is not result-driven. I’m saying that knowing the right people and having a professional network is much more important in here than in Europe. That partly constituted a cultural shock that I found myself in. Paired with my personality, that is the biggest challenge that I found myself working with.

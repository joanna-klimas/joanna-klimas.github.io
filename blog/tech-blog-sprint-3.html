          Let’s imagine that you are not an EDA student, facilitator or teacher (let’s face it, if you read this chances are you are). You have never heard of HTML, CSS and JS and you really want to understand what they are. All three of them build a lot of web pages that you navigate through every day. I will not be original here and use "the house analogy" to describe relationships between them.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          HTML is all the heavy stuff. Bricks, wood, everything that is needed on a construction site. With HTML we would lay foundations, build the walls and roof. Once all that is done, we’d hire an interior designer. That’s CSS. Painting the walls, making the flooring, adding some furniture. JS would come next and make the magic happen. Sound system, maybe a game console, Alexa and Siri, maybe an alarm and cameras (I come from Europe, we like to be safe;).
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          JS is like any other language. If you tried learning some, you know that first you start understanding when others speak, and after awfully long and painful time you start speaking yourself. With lots of mistakes at first, getting better and better every day as you train. JS is the same. And as any other language (besides Arabic), reads from top to bottom, from left to right. That’s control flow. What can break it is conditionals and loops.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I will take an example of my dog to describe a loop. When he wants to play he brings one of his toys to me (var i = 0) and I throw it for him. He runs, catches it and brings it back to me (i++). I again throw, he again runs, catches and brings it back. If it was up to him this would be an infinite loop… He never gets tired. Fortunately I do, so when I’m done, I break the loop and we finally continue with our lives (my dog actually does not, he still tries to play).

          The DOM
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Let’s say that for some unknown and possibly wrong reason you have decided to write all of your code in one line. Unlike most of the people, the DOM is a tool that will make sense of it. It reads the code, looks for logic and builds a tree of parents, children and siblings out of it. The DOM allows us to access all of the elements on the page and manipulate them using devtools.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium title is-4">
          Accessing data in arrays and in objects
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Accessing data in arrays is a pretty straight forward task. Quoting Kirupa, an array „helps store, retrieve, and manipulate a collection of data”. Here is an example of an array:
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          var weekDays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
        </p>   
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Each of the strings in this array has an index, starting with 0 assigned to Monday. To access the strings we need to use their indexes:
        </p> 
        <p class="content is-medium">
          weekDays[3] will access "Thursday”.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Voila!
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          There are a few ways of accessing data in the objects. Two of them are fairly similar. Let’s take a simple object like this.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          var person = { </br>
          name: "Joanna", </br>
          age: 57, //obviously !== true</br>
          interests: "music"</br>
          }
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          We can access property of this object using dot notation like this: </br>
          person.interests</br>
          returns "music"
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          or bracket notation like this
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          person["age"]</br>
          returns 57
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium title is-4">
          Functions
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Moving onto the functions. Functions are reusable pieces of code. Once defined can be called when we want the magic to happen.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I’m out of batteries. Writing this blog post took me so much time, as a result I can’t elaborate on functions:)

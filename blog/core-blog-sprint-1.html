          I have a few years of HR experience under my belt and I got a chance to fill out a few personality tests and work with the results. I suppose this gives me quite an in-depth understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          What I value the most is logic. I’m quite good at putting emotions aside and focusing on different factors and their consequences. I enjoy solving problems and building complex logical concepts. I often ask myself „is that the best way?”. These qualities can be easily seen as both my strengths and weaknesses.

          Some time ago I was made responsible for an optimization project. I was supposed to analyze certain processes in the business and look for efficiencies. The reason why I was chosen to go ahead with this project was being logical and analytical, and really interested in optimization. I happily started working on mapping processes and people’s roles, followed by remapping both. I thought it was very exciting to free up people’s time and potential. What I did not pay enough attention to was that some of my colleagues found it horrifying.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Following my logical train of thought often makes me forget about emotional support others may need. I am type of person who asked to listen about other’s problems will start suggesting solutions and looking for logic. While what others often need is someone to JUST listen.

          I come from a culture driven by results. Of course, the process of getting to them is important too, but what really matters is not how big and impressive my professional network is, but what I accomplished. Being in NZ for almost 2 years I found that professional culture here is quite different. I’m not saying that NZ is not result-driven. I’m saying that knowing the right people and having a professional network is much more important in here than in Europe. That partly constituted a cultural shock that I found myself in. Paired with my personality, that is the biggest challenge that I found myself working with.

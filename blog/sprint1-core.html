        <h1>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset</h1>
        <p>
          Referring back to my previous post on emotional intelligence, I have to admit that I was wrong about IQ. Looking a little deeper and reading a few articles about growth mindset and neuroplasticity I realized that there is nothing static about our brains, including IQ. In fact, thinking that IQ is a static value is an example of fixed mindset approach.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting back to the subject of this post. What I think is important about growth and fixed mindset, is understanding that we make choices between two of them every day. Neuroplasticity is a fact. There are number of studies proving that growth mindset boosts learning experience. Why not make a choice each time when faced with a challenge than? 
        </p>

        <p>
          I was thinking of how to incorporate a growth mindset into my learning experience. There are a few tools that already facilitate it. That includes reflection, meditation, writing this sort of posts. At the end, a lot about it is self-awareness and being able to identify which state am I in, and consciously switch it if needed. Or celebrate, if it’s not. This makes it really close to emotional intelligence as an ability to identify and regulate emotions. Mindset is essentially how do we feel about certain situation. Being aware and regulating these two mindset is essentially mastering EQ.

        <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, interpret and regulate our own feelings and feelings of the others. When I say recognize, I mean take a moment and really understand what do we feel. Is it just anger, or maybe disappointment? Is it happiness? Or maybe pride? Or maybe something else? Being emotionally intelligent means going a little deeper than just observing the surface of our emotions. Once a person is able to correctly name the feeling, they are a step closer to understanding it, and trying to regulate behaviors based on that knowledge. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Emotional intelligence has nothing to do with IQ. IQ is static. We are born with certain capacity and we can’t really change it through the course of our lives. IQ has no impact on EQ, meaning that people with high IQ can have either high or low EQ. EQ is a skill that can be learned. 
        </p>

        <p>
          High levels of EQ are directly correlated with success. I’m perfectly aware how this sounds, but that really is a conclusion drawn from every source I referred to while researching this topic. Higher levels of EQ are observed in people on middle-management level in professional organizations. People with higher EQ levels are able to form more meaningful relationships, hence are happier. 
        </p>

        <p class="last-p">
          What I find appealing in working on EQ is its’ almost therapeutical impact. Taking time to understand emotions and accepting that they are okey, no matter if the general perception of  anger or rage are bad, and happiness or love are good. They are all very human, and what defines us is our reactions to the emotions, not emotions themselves.

          I plan my days using icalendar. I block certain times to complete my work and try to stick to the plan. If I find it hard to focus, I take a few minutes break to relax. I’m being profesional and always deliver what I have promised.

          I try my best to find solutions to problems I encounter by myself. I will reach out to my fellow colleagues on slack if I get stuck for longer than 30-45 minutes. I will reach out to EDA staff if other students are not able to help me.

          I have a few years of HR experience under my belt and I got a chance to fill out a few personality tests and work with the results. I suppose this gives me quite an in-depth understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. 
        </p>
              
        <p>
          What I value the most is logic. I’m quite good at putting emotions aside and focusing on different factors and their consequences. I enjoy solving problems and building complex logical concepts. I often ask myself „is that the best way?”. These qualities can be easily seen as both my strengths and weaknesses.

          Some time ago I was made responsible for an optimization project. I was supposed to analyze certain processes in the business and look for efficiencies. The reason why I was chosen to go ahead with this project was being logical and analytical, and really interested in optimization. I happily started working on mapping processes and people’s roles, followed by remapping both. I thought it was very exciting to free up people’s time and potential. What I did not pay enough attention to was that some of my colleagues found it horrifying.
        </p>
              
        <p>
          Following my logical train of thought often makes me forget about emotional support others may need. I am type of person who asked to listen about other’s problems will start suggesting solutions and looking for logic. While what others often need is someone to JUST listen.

          I come from a culture driven by results. Of course, the process of getting to them is important too, but what really matters is not how big and impressive my professional network is, but what I accomplished. Being in NZ for almost 2 years I found that professional culture here is quite different. I’m not saying that NZ is not result-driven. I’m saying that knowing the right people and having a professional network is much more important in here than in Europe. That partly constituted a cultural shock that I found myself in. Paired with my personality, that is the biggest challenge that I found myself working with.

          Bootcamp learning plan
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I would like to completely restart my career and use the experience and knowledge I already have to step into IT world in a tech role. I would like to get to an expert level within a few years and be able to work from whatever part of the world I want. I want my career be translatable to any other country I want to visit in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I would like to be able to find a job after completing the bootcamp and chose a company I can stay with for longer. Before joining Dev-Academy I thought a lot about industry I’d like to dedicate my time to. I came to conclusion I’d like to work for a business that makes a change to people. One of the ideas is NGO or an innovative technology based company. 
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I think my strengths are clear motivation, focus on end result and seeing a bigger picture. So far I found programming quite absorbing and I’m sure it can become my passion. I think it’s important to really being interested in things that we do for life. As long as I find programming interesting, I will be able to focus on it and learn as much as I can in such a short period of time. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          As per limitations, I always try to find a solution myself. If I get too much help I feel I did not achieve something I had in mind. I’m not saying I can’t work in a group - I can and I will surly enjoy it. It’s more of trying to fit my own expectations that I have set for myself. I’m probably the toughest judge I have ever met. It may be quite difficult to cope with not meeting my own expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I’m not a public speaker, nor a skilled presenter. English is not my first language, so it does not help when I’m in a stressful situation. Developer’s job does not, most of the time, include much public speaking, so I assume I should be fine in the future:) Language barrier can be still quite annoying in everyday life, especially while using very technical language that I did not have much exposure to. 
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          There is no such a thing as being too self-aware. I’m really interested in getting to know myself better (sounds quite self-centered…) I got really interested in growth mindset theory and EQ and I would like to consciously work on these and observe my reactions and changes in my behavior. 
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I know it will be challenging 9 weeks. I would also like to stay focus on learning and get as much as I can from this time. 
        </p>
        <p class="title is-4">
          What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I suppose being realistic about what kind of challenges we will be coming across in „real IT world”, in professional environment. Offering support with technical knowledge, pushing me the right direction if needed but not just giving me the answers. Understanding that most of problems we came across are completely unfamiliar and it may take some time for certain concepts to sink in. So patience in explaining, sometimes probably more than once.

          Learning plan - foundations
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          4 April 2019
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          My strengths:
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Dedication, seeing a big picture, motivation to change my career, high orientation on logic, good interaction with people.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          My limitations:
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          Not always following instructions and looking for different paths instead, hard to get into flow if I’m not absolutely passionate about a topic, problems with focusing on end-delivery if project is too long
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I plan my days using icalendar. I block certain times to complete my work and try to stick to the plan. If I find it hard to focus, I take a few minutes break to relax. I’m being profesional and always deliver what I have promised.
        </p>
        <p class="content is-medium">
          I try my best to find solutions to problems I encounter by myself. I will reach out to my fellow colleagues on slack if I get stuck for longer than 30-45 minutes. I will reach out to EDA staff if other students are not able to help me.

          Going through katas I came across a few problems that got me stuck. Sometimes I needed someone else to push me the right direction. Sometimes I was able to work the solution out myself. This is going to be an example of a second case. It was when I worked on kata on build-in functions. After relatively easily completing previous ones, I was quite confident about that one too. For some reason I thought I will only need to call one of the build-in functions, like join(), and the kata will be completed.

          When I started solving it I realized that it wouldn’t be as easy as I anticipated. I was trying to find a solution for some time and than I’ve noticed I’m actually just trying to guess instead using some of the problem solving techniques. And let me tell you, it took me a few hours to come to this conclusion.

          So I restarted my work, sit to it with a fresh mind, and started with writing a pseudocode. After that, in shockingly short period of time, I also wrote a working function…

          Since the beginning of foundations I was quite skeptical about problem solving process. When I first read it, I thought it was quite obvious. We are all adults and we solved a few problems in our lives before, so I suppose we all should have our own processes. Well, as good (or not) as they work in every day life, they are not always applicable to code writing. And that’s pretty much what I took out of this situation. There is a reason why we are being introduced to every single module in this course.
